This is a very tiny Perl binding which has one single function call which uses
a few functions in SimGear. It is mainly by fg_server_xml.cgi to convert the
orientation values from the FG server into heading/pitch/roll.

For convenience the binary for x86-32 and x86-64 are included in the tree. You
may need to update the blib symlink to point to the right one.

If you need to, say, host FGMap on a platform other than x86, or if the
prebuilt binary doesn't work on your system for whatever reasons, you'll want
to build this yourself. You'll need swig (apt-get install swig on Debian) to
rebuild this. A 'make clean' followed by a 'make' should do it,

Also you might want to edit the makefile (not Makefile, so that it won't be
confused with those Makefile.PL etc) for the location of SimGear and PLIB.
SG_PREFIX and PLIB_PREFIX specify the prefix of your simgear and plib
installation. The two might be the same, depending on your setup. Default is
/usr/local for both of them.
